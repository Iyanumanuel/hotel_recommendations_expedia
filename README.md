## Machine learning model to predict hotel recommendations

Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/expedia-hotel-recommendations/data

In this project, I used data that falls into the top 10 categories, using about 1 % of the dataset provided (due to time constrain and machine limitations). Majority of the notebooks were run on Google colab

A few different machine learning algorithms were tested out to obtain the best result. The machine learning models include:
1) Keras Neural Network
2) Decision Tree
3) Xgboost
